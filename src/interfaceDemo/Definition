What is Interface?
=> Interface is set of rules and contract.
=> In java, we can create interface by using interface keyword.
=> Once interface is created, we can have variables and methods inside an interface.
=> All variables are static and final in interface.
=> All methods are by default abstract, we don't need to give abstract keyword in method signature.
=> Interfaces are implemented using "Implements" keyword.
=> Java class can implement any number of interface.
=> If we implement interface in a class, we should give definitions for all methods.

=> Interface discussion is not fulfilled without discussing about Dynamic Binding.
